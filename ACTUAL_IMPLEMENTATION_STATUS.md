# Implementation Status

## Completed

- [x] Phase 1: Add UID Translation Helpers
- [x] Phase 2: Update Settings Schema
- [x] Phase 3: Update MenuBarManager to Use UIDs

## Status

All planned tasks from the previous status update have been implemented. The application now persists device settings using UIDs, which should ensure settings are retained across app restarts and device reconnections.

## Next Steps

- Verify the fix by running the application and checking if settings persist after restarting the app.
- Test with different audio devices to ensure UIDs are correctly resolved.
